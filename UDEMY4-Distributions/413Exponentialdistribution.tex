MathsCast: The exponential distribution
 
 

Purpose of the Exponential Distribution:

Question 
An average of five calls per hour are received by a machine repair department. 
Beginning the observation at any point in time, what is the probability that the first call for service will arrive within a half hour?

The exponential distribution is a memoryless distribution.

Suppose you buy a new mobile phone. What is the probability of a fault within six months?

Suppose you have this mobile phone for 12 months. What is the probability of a fault with six months?

Under the assumption ,the property of being memoryless means that, for both situations, the probability of a fault within six months is the same.

(The assumption of a constant would be unsuitable in many cases)


The exponential distribution plays a central role in a large class of problems related to the concept of "lifetime". 
For example, an electronic component might be known to have a lifetime of, say, 10.000h. 
This means that the component is expected to fail after about 10.000h of use. 
But of course, this is an average value, and some components from the same batch will last less than 10.000 hours, while others will last longer. 
So the lifetime of a component is a random variable.
