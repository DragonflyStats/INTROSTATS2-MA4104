D Hypothesis Testing - Example
The catering manager in a hotel suspects that the weight of loaves of bread delivered
daily by a bakery is consistently below the nominal weight of 800g. To test this,
10 loaves chosen at random from a dayâ€™s deliveries are weighed. The mean and
standard deviation of the ten weights are 792g and 25g, respectively.
 
1) Carry out a formal significance test.
2) List the steps involved in this test 
3) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average weight of loaves produced
4) Comment on the correspondence between the interval, as calculated, and the
    result of the test.
