\section*{Question 1} %MOVED TO WEEK 2

A doctor treating a patient issues a prescription for antibiotics and provides for two repeat prescriptions. The probability that the infection will be cleared by the first prescription is p1 =0.6. 


The probability that successive treatments are successful, given that previous prescriptions were not successful are $p_2$ = 0.5, $p_3$ = 0.4. Calculate the probability that  

\begin{itemize}   
\item[(a.)] the patient is still infected after the third prescription,
\item[(b.)] the patient is cured by the second prescription,
\item[(c.)] the patient does not require a third prescription,
\item[(d.)] the patient is cured by the second prescription, given that the patient is eventually cured.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 2}
A driver passes through 3 traffic lights. The chance he/she will stop at the first is 1/2 , at the second 1/3 and at the third Â¼ independently of what happens at any of the other lights. 

What is the probability that
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]. the driver makes the whole journey without being stopped at any of the lights
\item[(b)]. the driver is only stopped at the first and third lights
\item[(c)]. the driver is stopped at just one set of lights.
\item[(d)]. the driver stopped at the second set of lights, given he/she stopped at one set of lights.
\end{itemize}
