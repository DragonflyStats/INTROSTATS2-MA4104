Qualitative Data
Quantitative Data
 
Discrete v Continuous
 
An experiment is
 
An observational study is
 
This is an experiment because the outcomes are a response to conditions set by the study.
 
 
Ratio v Interval
 
The difference between ratio and interval is most evident in how a value of zero is treated.
 
For Ratio values – a value of zero means the complete absence.
For interval values
 
Consider that 0 degrees centigrade is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
ordinal
nominal (Categorical)
 
For example consider a variable”origin” where the outcomes are Limerick /Rest of Munster/Rest of Ireland/Rest of World.
 
ordinal – contains a hierarchy
 
Discrete:
 
Number of Children in a class
Number of faulty components per batch
 
Continuous
 
Length of time between cars arriving at a petrol station pump.
 
 
It  is not possible have 24.5 children in any class, but it is possible to have an average of 24.5 per class.

Section 2 Graphical methods
 
Pie Charts – hard to make out what is going on.
Some aesthetic use i.e. breaking up a long page of text.
 
Section 3: Probability
Law of total probability
 
Independent events
 
Conditional probability
 
Given that event B has already occurred ,   what is the probability of event A
 
P( A | B)  “probability of A given B”
 
P( A and B) “ probability of A and B”
 
Complement event
 
What is the probability of A not happening
What is the probability of outcomes not included in A.
 
Section 4: Probability Distributions
 
Expected value of the outcome
 
E[X]
 
By definition the expected value is the value that 50% of the the outcomes are greater than.By extension 50% of values are less than the Expected value.
 
P( X \geq E[X])  = 0.50  P(X \leq E[X]) = 0.50
 
Binomial Distribution
Number of independent trials
 
A coin is tossed eight times. – the number of trials is therefore 8.
 
A group of people or a batch of items can also be considered as a series of independent trials.
 
Probability of a success
 
A “success” is dependent on how the question is framed, or what is being estimated.
 
Continuous Uniform distribution
 
L :lower bound of an interval
U: upper bound of an interval
 
Probability of an outcome being between lower bound L and upper bound U
P( L \leq X \leq U)  =  { U - L \over  b – a }
 
 
Reminder
 
" \leq" is less than or equal to
 
" \geq" is greater than or equal to
 
 
L \leq X \leq U
 
simply states that X is between L and U inclusively.
 
("inclusively" mean that X could be exactly L or U also, although the probability of this is extremely low)
 
 
The probability density function is given as
 
f(x) = {1 \over b-a} for a \leq x \leq b
 
For any value "c" between the minimum value a and the maximum value b
 
P(X \ geq c) = {b-c \over b-a}
 
here b is the upper bound while c is the lower bound
 
 
P(X \ leq c) = {c-a \over b-a}
 
here c is the upper bound while a is the lower bound
